        <p> Our definition of workspace has morphed and broadened since the Covid-19 pandemic first sent us home over
            two years ago. When offices and academic institutions first shuttered their doors and moved online in March
            2020, those on both ends of the Zoom had to adjust their habits to meet the new normal’s demands. For some
            students, these changes to study habits and patterns have lasted longer than expected. </p>





        <p>Prior to the pandemic, David Charendoff, a 22-year-old mechanical engineering student at the University of
            Maryland, did the majority of his work in McKeldin Library’s study carrels. Charendoff struggles to focus
            and liked how the environment pushed him to concentrate. </p>



        <p>When he got back to school last fall, Charendoff was excited to jump into his routine, but found it more
            difficult than anticipated. Now a senior, Charendoff still hasn’t returned to his former favorite location.
        </p>
        <p>
            A combination of McKeldin only being available in a limited capacity last year and Zoom burnout kept him
            studying in his room. “I haven’t been in McKeldin for probably my entire senior year,” he said. “I just fell
            out of the habit.” </p>

        <p> Shira Laserson, a 22-year-old community health major, also
            experienced burnout due to the pandemic . A naturally extraverted person, Laserson
            loves to do work around other people. Her work ethic was impacted and she struggled with anxiety when faced
            with more
            alone time than she
            was used to. </p>

        <p>Online school and social isolation led to increased burnout and anxiety, affecting students across America,
            according to <a
                href="http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2021/07/26/survey-anxiety-depression-and-burnout-on-the-rise-as-college-students-prepare-to-return-to-campus/">
                a study conducted at Ohio State university</a>. According to <a
                href="https://www.mhanational.org/issues/2022/mental-health-america-adult-data">surveys done by Mental
                Health America</a>, the
            percentage of adults with any mental illness has been on the rise in Maryland for the last six years,
            peaking during the pandemic.</p>

        <p> Shira Laserson, a 22-year-old community health major, experienced mental health struggles due to the
            pandemic firsthand. A naturally extraverted person, Shira's work ethic was impacted as she struggled with
            burnout when faced with more alone time than she was used to. Now that things have adjusted back to in
            person, Shira's habits are returning to normal. She spends a lot of time studying in her apartment
            building’s workspace, she said.
        </p>


        <p> For Wendy Kellman, a 23-year-old psychology major, pandemic-induced changes in her study patterns have
            proved permanent. Wendy primarily used to study with other people in lecture halls and libraries across
            campus. When things went online, that stopped abruptly. </p>

        <p> Wendy's classes have mainly stayed online and her bedroom has become her primary study space. “I'm just
            not as out and about as I used to be. I spend most of my time in the apartment,” said Wendy. “I haven’t
            socially studied since the pandemic started. Even in my apartment I don’t do homework with friends anymore,”
            Wendy said. </p>

        <p>
            Though adjusting to the pandemic was difficult for David and Shira, now that they’re nearing the
            other side, they’ve noticed positive changes in the academic environment.
        </p>
        <p> Shira found that the pandemic changed many of her peers and teachers’ outlook on mental health, changing
            the academic environment. ”I don’t know if it’s because of the pandemic or just a shift in society but
            people are a lot more open about admitting when they’re struggling.”

        </p>
        <p>David, an observant Jew, found that the pandemic has also changed people’s perspectives on religious
            accomodations. “Everyone’s already learned how to use Zoom, so like, if I ask a teacher to record a lecture
            for me when there’s a holiday or something, they’re much more understanding about it.”</p>

        <p>
            David also found that this flexibility has allowed him to return home to his family in New York for the
            holidays. “There were times when I’d stay in school even when I really wanted to be home, and now because
            people have learned to be flexible, I have this freedom.”
        </p>


        <p>According to Shira, while being affected by world events drained her, as a community health major, they
            also motivated her academically. “I’ve seen how communities hurt together, but I realized
            during everything how important it was to learn ways to help them heal together too,” Shira said. </p>
