        <p> Our definition of workspace has morphed and broadened since the Covid-19 pandemic first sent us home over
            two years ago. When offices and academic institutions first shuttered their doors and moved online in March
            2020, those on both ends of the Zoom had to adjust their habits to meet the new normal’s demands. For some
            students, these changes to study habits and patterns have lasted longer than expected. </p>





        <p>Prior to the pandemic, David Charendoff, a 22-year-old mechanical engineering student at the University of
            Maryland, did the majority of his work in McKeldin Library’s study carrels. Charendoff struggles to focus
            and liked how the environment pushed him to concentrate. </p>



        <p>When he got back to school last fall, Charendoff was excited to jump into his routine, but found it more
            difficult than anticipated. Now a senior, Charendoff still hasn’t returned to his former favorite location.
        </p>
        <p>
            A combination of McKeldin only being available in a limited capacity last year and Zoom burnout kept him
            studying in his room. “I haven’t been in McKeldin for probably my entire senior year,” he said. “I just fell
            out of the habit.” </p>

        <p>Online school and social isolation led to increased burnout and anxiety, affecting students across America,
            according to <a

                a study conducted at Ohio State university</a>. According to <a
                href="https://www.mhanational.org/issues/2022/mental-health-america-adult-data">surveys done by Mental
                Health America</a>, the
            percentage of adults with any mental illness has been on the rise in Maryland for the last six years,
            peaking during the pandemic.</p>

        <p> Shira Laserson, a 22-year-old community health major, experienced mental health struggles due to the
            pandemic firsthand. A naturally extraverted person, Shira's work ethic was impacted as she struggled with
            burnout when faced with more alone time than she was used to. Now that things have adjusted back to in
            person, Shira's habits are returning to normal. She spends a lot of time studying in her apartment
            building’s workspace, she said.
        </p>


        <p> For Wendy Kellman, a 23-year-old psychology major, pandemic-induced changes in her study patterns have
            proved permanent. Wendy primarily used to study with other people in lecture halls and libraries across
            campus. When things went online, that stopped abruptly. </p>

        <p> Wendy's classes have mainly stayed online and her bedroom has become her primary study space. “I'm just
            not as out and about as I used to be. I spend most of my time in the apartment,” said Wendy. “I haven’t
            socially studied since the pandemic started. Even in my apartment I don’t do homework with friends anymore,”
            Wendy said. </p>

        <p>
            Though adjusting to the pandemic was difficult for David and Shira, now that they’re nearing the
            other side, they’ve noticed positive changes in the academic environment.
        </p>
        <p> Shira found that the pandemic changed many of her peers and teachers’ outlook on mental health, changing
            the academic environment. ”I don’t know if it’s because of the pandemic or just a shift in society but
            people are a lot more open about admitting when they’re struggling.”

        </p>
        <p>David, an observant Jew, found that the pandemic has also changed people’s perspectives on religious
            accomodations. “Everyone’s already learned how to use Zoom, so like, if I ask a teacher to record a lecture
            for me when there’s a holiday or something, they’re much more understanding about it.”</p>

        <p>
            David also found that this flexibility has allowed him to return home to his family in New York for the
            holidays. “There were times when I’d stay in school even when I really wanted to be home, and now because
            people have learned to be flexible, I have this freedom.”
        </p>


        <p>According to Shira, while being affected by world events drained her, as a community health major, they
            also motivated her academically. “I’ve seen how communities hurt together, but I realized
            during everything how important it was to learn ways to help them heal together too,” Shira said. </p>

    <h1>Shira</h1>
    <br>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Shira knows what she wants when it comes to her ideal study space. A conscientious student, Shira has a set
            system for how to do work and wants her space to be conducive to that. </p>

        <p>"I tend to look for big desks where I can sit with good posture. This might sound silly, but a lot of the
            desks in the library are really low down, which naturally makes me slouch and makes my back hurt. I also
            look for a place where I can really spread out. I’m a good note taker so I'll often have my laptop and a
            book and my planner open. I need space to keep it all organized."</p>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Shira's favorite spot is in her apartment building's shared study space. There's a 12-foot-long table in the
            center of the space. It fits all of Shira's desired study-space characteristics. Even better, it's usually
            empty because people think the chairs are too high off the ground, said Shira.</p>

        <p> Shira likes working with friends, or just sitting somewhere she can see people walking by.“I always like
            having a little bit of social interaction while I'm working because it helps with my brainpower," she said.
        </p>

    <h1>David</h1>
    <br>

    <div class="main">
        <p>David is a self-described "distracted studier." Since the pandemic started it's gotten worse, he says. When
            things moved online, David had a tough adjustment. He studies best in public settings, like UMD's McKeldin
            Library, where he feels pressure to stay focused.</p>

        <p> “In McKeldin I’m not just gonna start throwing my bouncy
            ball against the wall you know? Like if I were to get up and start pacing or dancing around the room that
            wouldn’t be socially acceptable. But I do do that in my apartment,” David said.</p>

    </figure>

    <div class="main">
        <p> David's roommate lent him a monitor to improve his study space. Though it helps him when he's working on
            more complex assignments, David admits to using the monitor to watch sports games. David, a senior, is
            graduating in May and starting his first job in August. He says that he
            wasn't able to get back into the same schoolwork rhythm because of the pandemic's timing relative to his
            college experience.</p>

        <p> “It’s tough because a lot of my friends and I figured out our futures and got jobs
            during this time so we went through the classic 'senioritis stop caring about work' thing at the same time
            as [Covid-19]. We just moved on.”

    <h1>Wendy</h1>
    <br>

    <div class="main">
        <p>"It's a bit of a mess, but it works," said Wendy, gesturing to her desk. Her desk sits in the corner of the
            ten-by-twelve single bedroom that she moved into last year. Wendy moved apartments right before junior year,
            her first semester back in College Park after the pandemic sent everyone home the previous March.</p>

        <p>Like her bedroom setup, a few other things haven't been the same for Wendy since the pandemic started.
            Because the majority of her classes have remained online for over two years, Wendy's bedroom has now become
            the place she spends most of her time. “I haven’t socially studied since the pandemic started. Even in my
            apartment I don’t do homework with friends anymore," she said. </p>
    </div>

    </figure>

    <div class="main">
        <p>
            The pandemic also led to Wendy distancing herself from many of her extracurriculars as they moved online.
            For example, by the time the service fraternity Wendy had been involved in returned in-person, she hadn’t
            seen her friends in three semesters, and many of them had graduated. She decided to leave the fraternity at
            the start of this year. “I sort of just lost my momentum for a lot of things,” she said.
