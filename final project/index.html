        <p> Our definition of workspace has morphed and broadened since the Covid-19 pandemic first sent us home over
            two years ago. When offices and academic institutions first shuttered their doors and moved online in March
            2020, those on both ends of the Zoom had to adjust their habits to meet the new normal’s demands. For some
            students, these changes to study habits and patterns have lasted longer than expected. </p>


        <p>Prior to the pandemic, David Charendoff, a 22-year-old mechanical engineering student at the University of
            Maryland, did the majority of his work in Mckeldin Library’s study carrels. Charendoff struggles to focus
            and liked how the environment pushed him to concentrate. </p>

        <p>When he got back to school last fall, Charendoff was excited to jump into his routine, but found it more
            difficult than anticipated. Now a senior, Charendoff still hasn’t returned to his former favorite location.
            A combination of Mckeldin only being available in a limited capacity last year and Zoom burnout kept him
            studying in his room. “I haven’t been in Mckeldin for probably my entire senior year,” he said. “I just fell
            out of the habit.” </p>

        <p>Online school and social isolation led to increased burnout and anxiety in college students across America,
            according to <a
                href="http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2021/07/26/survey-anxiety-depression-and-burnout-on-the-rise-as-college-students-prepare-to-return-to-campus/">a
                study conducted at Ohio State university</a>. Reported anxiety and burnout increased by over 30%
            between August 2020 and April 2021, the study found. </p>
        <p>
            Shira Laserson, a 22-year-old community health major,
            experienced mental health struggles due to the pandemic firsthand. A naturally extraverted person,
            Laserson’s work ethic was impacted as she struggled with burnout when faced with more alone time than she
            was used to.</p>

        <p> One benefit Laserson found was that the pandemic changed many of her peers and teachers’ outlook on mental
            health, changing
            the academic environment. ”I don’t know if it’s because of the pandemic or just a shift in society but
            people are a lot more open about admitting when they’re struggling.”</p>

        <p>According to Laserson, while being affected by world events drained her, because they relate to the content
            of her major, they also motivated her academically. “I’ve seen how communities hurt together, but I realized
            during everything how important it was to learn ways to help them heal together too,” said Laserson. </p>
